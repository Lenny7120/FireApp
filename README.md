EOverview

The Emergency App is a mobile application designed to provide users with a quick and efficient way to report emergencies such as fires, accidents, or situations requiring rescue. The app allows users to register an account, select the type of emergency, and confirm their location. The collected information is then securely transmitted to an organization's server for prompt response.
